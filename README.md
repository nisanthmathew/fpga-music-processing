The project was implemented in Altera DE2_115 development board.
softwares used: Quartus prime lite edition , eclipsec-nios2
A simple music processing project n VHDL and niosII with equaliser, volume control and LED meter functions.
LED meter and Volume controls were implemented in VHDL.
Equaliser was implemented in Nios2.


Note: There are still some noise creeping into the system while processing. Improvements needs to be done for better Processing.
